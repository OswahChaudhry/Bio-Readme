A brief introduction about me and what I hope to achieve by learning to use GitHub.

Hi my name is Oswah Chaudhry and I am a rising senior at Herricks High School. I want to major in technology in the future so I am taking a fellowship called the Karim Kharbouch coding fellowship. This fellowship taught me many things so far like UX/UI design and also learning things through the site GitHub. My goals after I learn more about GitHub are to create a stunning portfolio that will impress employers by showing all the projects I made with the fellowship and outside of this program in the future and also to make repositories on my own.
